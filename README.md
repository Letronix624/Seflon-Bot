# Seflon-Bot
This is the source code to my Discord bot that connects to the Minecraft server console and commands its commands through a set Discord channel, that shouldn't be accessible to everyone.
This bot is unsafe. If a Discord account is hacked the hacker could delete the server or do bad stuff with the console.
This Bot was made by Let (Letronix624#9040).
Please don't put spaces in the directories. This bot will fail if the server or bot are stored in a folder or in a folder of a folder that has spaces in the name.
To Setup just open Consolebot.py . You need to have python installed for this.
It will setup as good as it can. If set up correctly it will send the commands sent in the Discord channel into the console and send the console output to Discord.
To get more information you could use server_help as a command in your server.
