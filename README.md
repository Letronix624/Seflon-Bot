# Seflon-Bot
This is the source code to my Discord bot that connects to the Minecraft server console and commands its commands through a set Discord channel, that shouldn't be accessible to everyone.
In order for this bot to work you would need a folder with an Minecraft server inside. At least a true Eula and a server.jar . I recommend to get these from papermc.io . Free.
Be sure to only trust friends or clients to have access to the Discord channel, your bot is in.
This Bot was made by Let (Letronix624#9040).
Please don't put spaces in the directories. This bot will fail if the server or bot are stored in a folder or in a folder of a folder that has spaces in the name.
To Setup just open Consolebot.py . You need to have python installed for this.
It will setup as good as it can. If set up correctly it will send the commands sent in the Discord channel into the console and send the console output to Discord.
To get more information you could use server_help as a command in your server. This bot requires an own Discord bot. If you don't have one follow my tutorial when first opening the bot.
I tried to describe the process as good as i can. You could follow an tutorial how to set up a bot on youtube too. Just search how to make a Discord bot profile.
