# Seflon-Bot
This is the source code to my Discord bot that connects to the Minecraft server console and commands its commands through a set Discord channel, that shouldn't be accessible to everyone. This bot is unsafe. If a Discord account is hacked the hacker could delete the server or do bad stuff with the console.
